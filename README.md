# scratchpad

Scratchpad is a super lightweight, simple note taker. This is not intended for production use, but is a great resource for homelabs / self-hosting platforms.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Security notes
This application has no authentication and no encryption. Again, this is meant to be a lightweight note server for your local network, **not** for public / production use.
